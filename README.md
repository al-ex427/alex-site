# Building
to build, you will need to have these requirements:
npm/node.js or any

~~also if you want to the discord user widget to work, you should copy .env.example and replace the discord token with any of your bot token to get the user info~~

now the actual first step:
run `npm install` to install all packages

after that run `npm run build` and you're done!
